# Gatsby TypeScript Starter

This starter will allow you to quickly scaffold a new Gatsby TypeScript project.

## Folders

1. **\_pages**: Components that you will render in the `pages` folder.
2. **components**: The individual parts that will make up your \_pages.
3. **context**: Global data.
4. **declarations**: Declaration files for modules that are not written in TypeScript.
5. **mirage**: Virtual back-end.
6. **pages**: The place, where you'll be rendering \_pages components.
7. **utils**: Standardized variables and functions you can use throughout your components (e.g. color, font size, etc.).
8. **wrappers**: Wrapper components, such as providers and layout.

## Gatsby Files

- **gastby-browser.js**: Allows MirageJS to run before intercepting any built-in Gatsby NodeJS operations.
- **gatsby-config.js**: Configuration file for Gatsby plugins.
- **gatsby-node.js**: Contains logic for simple file import syntax.
- **gatsby-ssr.js**: Haven't had the need to touch this, yet.
